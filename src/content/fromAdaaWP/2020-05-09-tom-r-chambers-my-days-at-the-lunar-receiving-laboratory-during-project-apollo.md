(May 25, 2016) Building 31 … after 44 years, I returned to Building 37 (Lunar Receiving Laboratory) at NASA (Houston) where I worked as a research analyst during the Apollo program, 1969-1972. The configuration of the interior of the building was totally different, but I did manage to walk these “hallowed” hallways, and meet some of the current personnel. Andrea Mosie, Lunar Lab Sample Laboratory manager is showing me one of the Lunar rock samples which is bagged and housed in a containment cabinet to prevent contamination. You notice we are wearing “bunny suits” to keep the area pristine. (Image courtesy of NASA.)
